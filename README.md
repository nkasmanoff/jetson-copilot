# Jetson Copilot

This repo contains the work to train (in a jupyter notebook) and deploy a small coding assistant LLM, which can be used to autocomplete code in a text editor. The model is trained on a small dataset of python code, and is deployed on a Jetson Nano.


## Remaining Steps

Model is fine-tuned and lives on HF. I figured out how to host it, and tested that on a separate environemnt. Just waiting for the updated SD card to work, set up a proxy server using ngrok, and then this thing is ready to go.
